day 7


mysql ----db
mysql workbench -----IDE----RAD tool---we can also connect to remote database.
(in our projrcts we use remote database.)
>>centralized database(out dated)/distributed databases(present working one).
example for distributed database:bank balance .....
>>>Transactions-----commit and rollback.
we can do transactions on databse only.


API-connecting to one to one,system to syetem by following rules and regulations.
API is a mediatory for all type of transactions .
API converts one form to anoher form,according to a requirement.
API is a userdefined and predefined.
for API developement and testing we have so many tools like JDBC,Rapid API(Is better to use),
Open API is a most used tool in nowadays .
>openApi is called as postman .

to store the data in backend we need - App--JDBC Driver----DB
servers are always dynamic.
db is a server.

JDBC API----
we have to layers
1.application layer 2.drivers

IOT---sensors

Datasource--origin point(from where ur data is streaming).
>EVERY CONNECTION TO A DATABASE IS CALLED AS SESSION.
example:   3 apps are conecting to same database.

>>sessiom will be invalidated.
>session1 ---going on-db
>session2--going on-db
 i made changes in db----



for connecting to drivers we have some main steps:
>loading drivers,
>establishing connction,
>creating statements,
>executing statements queries,
>handle result,
>close connection.


for developer-it is request,,but for servers it is thread.

R&D is the most required thing to developers

Task1:  Explore***Sticky session***
Every servers will have filters fo sure.
fileters are not ment for develpement.it is software progamm
in JDBC we have dbfilters
>>phishing filter:it is more about security.this filter we see in chrome to filter the data,to protect the data fro autorized activities.

mysql---for learning
mysql workbench --- for projects and development
>alternative for mysql workbench we can go with the eclipse datasoure features ,toad for mysql,.....etc
 toad for mysql and oracle is totally different.


to download jar file>>>>>>>>GA(General availaility).it is for public use.
dont use alpha/beta/snapshot versions directly without team approaval.

in projects we will use corporate repositories.IT team will place all dependence in a common orporate repositpory 
>any repository that we create an organization for internal purpose is called as corporate repository.

but,we are going to use the tool NEXUS SONARTYPE/Jfog repository managers.

>>IT team will perform jar scanning(scans entire jar to check whether it is secure or not) for vulnarabilities.


Network we create for internal purpose of an organization is called as INTRANET.

****MAVEN TOOL****
dependency management tool/build tool.
GRADLE is tough compitetor for MAVEN.
MAVEN is inbuilt in eclipse.


****"git clone https://github.com/kolaparthi34k/Infinite_JavaBackend/tree/main/Jdbc"**** for dowloading the files
>>>mysql details:
connection metadata of mysql
username :root
>password:mysql@123 or mysql123@
>Drivername:com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
Db server ipaddress:localhost/127.0.0.1(loopback address)/ipaddress



connection metadata of oracle
username :root
>password:mysql@123 or mysql123@
>Drivername:oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
Db server ipaddress:localhost/127.0.0.1(loopback address)/ipaddress


every service or protocol runs on specific port no:
http:8080
https:8443/443
mysql:3306
otacle




https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/8.0.28



once the connection done the main thing we show concentrate on resultset.
resultset is the main thing.
resultset have manysets in jdbc
which wwe use for the connections.



 
pagination-used for displaying the content on the webpage
batch -executes all mysql quaries at a time.
concurrency-modification of the date on resultset,
type -used for cursor to move from top to down or down to top.

task-2:"types of resultset and concurency"
write jdbc code to create the statements for insert update delete"(dynamic data)

Drawbacks:

1)Make the values insert at runtime.
Solution)Use PreparedStatement

2)connection closing shld be in final.Final will run irrespective of exceptions in the  code.
Solution)Can be handled in code.
JDBC ,SErve
3)Not portable
Solution)Use properties or XML files.

4)password shld not disclosed in code.
solution:1)if we need to use the password in code,encrypty the password and then use.
2)Place password in VAULT server or AWS Secrets manager  and pull password from  there.(prefered).Integrate vault code with JAva code.
3)USe properties file and place your encrypted password in properties or xml or YAML file.
"""VAult is the mostly use approach in now a days world"""

5)driver class,url and passwords should be dynamic.
solution)can be achieved using 4 the step.


>prepared statements,LOB datatypes,saving images in db,batch operation,calling functios using callable statements.


>>LOB stands for Large objects.

========================================
Task1: SQL injection                    
****(20th)----wallet webapplication.    
>>JDBC,Servlets,Jsp****  

Task2: Using prepared  statement insert single character into employee fullname.

i/p:a
o/p: record inserted successfully

i/p:abcdd
o/p:please provide character data.Operation Failed.
             
========================================

>"prepared statement:"
>this is mainly for i serting values to the queries at runtime.
>prepared statement helps us to avoid SQL INjection upto some extent80%
to use effectively prepard statement,if u follow the syands then injection is not possible.
>in prepared statements we use "?" as a place holder


fiddle
SQL,PL/SQL(SQL+programming concepts),Forms and reports
>>callable statemnets: used for calling functions/stored procedures in databases.

>>oracle ADF--servlets-used for the interanl portal


Image into database:

create table imagestab(imagefile blob);
Using JDBC code ,we should insert file to table.


stream:follow of data continueously is called as stream


PreparedStatement ps=con.prepareStatement("insert into imgtable values(?,?)");  
ps.setString(1,"sonoo");  

FileInputStream fin=new FileInputStream("d:\\g.jpg");  
ps.setBinaryStream(2,fin,fin.available());  
int i=ps.executeUpdate();  
System.out.println(i+" records affected");



""process of creating structure of a folder is called as scaffolding""


=====
"Servlets"

servlets comes under serverside technology
servelets is mainly used for webapplication.
>servlet is a web component.
to design an application we need to follow servlets ap specification.
>works on http and https protocol
servers uses jdk
servelts works as front contoller(runner) in spring(mvc).

servers are of 2types
1)web server:
http(s/w)(1.0,2.0,2.1,3.x --versions)when we deal with normal data which doesnt need security)
https(httpf+ssl\ls)when we deal with sensitive data
+
catalina(runs servlets progrsams)
+
jasper(containor for jsp programs)
+
middleware servers (min 6)(ex:lifecycle management,transaction mg ma,connection pooling,jndi{java naming directory services} service,)
+
ejb container(cotainer to run ejb program)
+
mq(messaing query)( container to run mq program)

webservers are always faster than application server.
ex:tomcat,jetty,ngns
webserver have less capability than the application server.


2)application server:glass fish,weblogic,web sphere,pramati....etc.
